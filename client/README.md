#### Initial commit

## Thursday, January 14 2021

#### This morning I finally got a chance to work on the registration and login, and at 9:31 am, I was able to get the backend and frontend to communicate successfully. With MERN, the approach is different. In C# ASP. NET authentication is handled with a session and a conditional statement that checks whether the user is authorized to view a page. With MERN, you use cookies and check to see if a user is authorized to view specific data. I was glad that I started this repo back in December because it was in the back of my mind while working on my portfolio. Since I have completed my portfolio, I had the change come back to this project. I had left this part out until the end because I was unsure if I could implement login and registration. Now that the login and registration are complete, I can implement all this knowledge into my portfolio.
